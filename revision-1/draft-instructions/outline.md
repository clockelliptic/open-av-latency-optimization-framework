#### **3. Theoretical Foundations**
   - **3.1 Practical Example: Latency in Autonomous Vehicles**
     - Start with a real-world scenario where an autonomous vehicle experiences latency in processing sensor data, resulting in delayed decision-making. For example, show how a delay in radar data could lead to late obstacle detection.
     - Explain how **queuing models** and **critical path analysis** are used to solve this problem by identifying bottlenecks and managing system performance.

   - **3.2 Queuing Theory for Latency Measurement**
     - **M/M/1 and M/M/m Models**: Introduce these basic queuing models, explaining how they measure latency at individual system nodes.
       - Present the core equation for **M/M/1**:
         \[
         L_i = \frac{1}{\mu_i - \lambda_i}
         \]
         where \(L_i\) is the latency, \(\mu_i\) is the service rate, and \(\lambda_i\) is the arrival rate.
       - Explain the extension to **M/M/m** models for nodes with multiple processors (e.g., GPUs).
     - **Limitations of Basic Models**: Introduce the **G/G/1 model**, which allows for general arrival and service time distributions. Explain that this model better reflects the variability seen in real-world autonomous systems, where tasks may not follow Poisson arrival patterns.
       - Briefly present the general formula for **G/G/1** queuing models and explain when it should be used in more complex systems.
     - **Assumptions and Adjustments**: Clearly state the assumptions of **Poisson arrivals** and **exponentially distributed service times** for M/M/1 models, and discuss how the model can be adapted if these assumptions do not hold.

   - **3.3 Critical Path Analysis**
     - **Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)** Representation: Introduce the concept of using a **DAG** to model the system, with nodes representing processing stages (e.g., perception, prediction) and edges representing dependencies.
     - **Critical Path Calculation**: Explain how the critical path represents the **longest chain of dependent tasks**, determining the system’s total latency. Present the critical path formula:
       \[
       L_{\text{total}} = \max_{\text{paths P}} \left( \sum_{(i,j) \in P} L_i + C_j \right)
       \]
       where \(L_i\) is the latency at each node, and \(C_j\) is the computation cost between nodes.
     - **Connecting Queuing Theory to Critical Path**: Show how the queuing model latencies (from M/M/1 or G/G/1 models) feed into the critical path calculation. Demonstrate how delays at individual nodes impact the overall critical path and system performance.
     - **Dynamic Critical Paths**: Discuss the potential for **dynamic critical paths**, where system bottlenecks shift over time as task loads change. Mention that this can be an area for future research, where **real-time path adjustment** could optimize latency under varying conditions.

   - **3.4 Latency Jitter and Variability**
     - **Quantifying Jitter**: Introduce the concept of **latency jitter**, which refers to the variability in task processing times. Provide the formula for measuring variance in latency at each node:
       \[
       \text{Var}(L_i) = \frac{\lambda_i^2}{(\mu_i - \lambda_i)^2 \cdot \mu_i^2}
       \]
     - **Practical Impact of Jitter**: Explain how jitter affects decision-making, particularly in real-time systems where slight variations in processing time can lead to significant performance degradation. 
     - **Jitter Management Techniques**: Introduce potential methods for managing jitter, such as **buffering**, **real-time scheduling adjustments**, or **dynamic task prioritization**. 
     - **Quantifying Critical Jitter Thresholds**: Provide insights into how jitter impacts **critical failure points**, such as when system delays exceed a safe threshold for decision-making. Discuss how these thresholds can be identified and monitored in the system.

       \[
       L_i = \frac{1}{\mu_i - \frac{\lambda_i}{\text{Priority}_i}}
       \]
