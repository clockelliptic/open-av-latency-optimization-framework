These papers address key challenges in **latency measurement**, **resilience in autonomous systems**, **failure prediction**, and **task offloading**. Here's a detailed comparison and integration of their insights into our work:

### **1. "Latency Measurement for Autonomous Driving Software Using Data Flow Extraction"**

This paper offers practical methods for measuring **latency in autonomous driving systems** by extracting and analyzing the flow of data through system components. It focuses on measuring **end-to-end latency** and determining where delays occur in the pipeline.

#### **Relation to Our Framework**:
- **Queuing Models**: Our use of **M/M/1** and **M/M/m queuing models** to measure latency at each processing stage (e.g., perception, prediction) directly reflects the need for capturing **node-level latencies**, as discussed in this paper.
- **Latency Graph**: The idea of **constructing a latency graph** and calculating the **critical path** aligns closely with the data flow extraction approach mentioned in the paper. Both our framework and this paper share the objective of identifying bottlenecks and measuring end-to-end delays in a systematic way.
  
#### **Mathematics Connection**:
- Our **latency graph construction** and the **critical path analysis** expand on the basic flow-extraction techniques by adding detailed queuing models, which provide more granular insight into how each node's processing time contributes to overall system latency.

#### **Integration in Our Framework**:
- The methods in this paper validate our approach of **tracking and measuring latency** across the autonomous system, especially in **perception and prediction** stages, and ensuring we have an implementable way to extract and represent these latencies.

### **2. "Know the Unknowns: Addressing Disturbances and Uncertainties in Autonomous Systems"**

This paper deals with **disturbances and uncertainties** in autonomous systems, focusing on how non-deterministic behavior and environmental factors affect performance. It introduces techniques for handling **critical path analysis** and managing system behavior under uncertainty.

#### **Relation to Our Framework**:
- **Handling Uncertainty**: This paper emphasizes the importance of managing **uncertain data** and **non-deterministic behavior**, which we have incorporated through our **priority-based latency model**. In particular, by prioritizing radar data in low-visibility conditions or other critical situations, we align with the paper’s focus on adapting system behavior to uncertainty.
- **Critical Path Analysis**: The paper’s emphasis on **critical path analysis** for handling uncertainties in the system is integrated into our approach to **critical path latency** measurement.

#### **Mathematics Connection**:
- Our model for **latency variability (jitter)** ties into the paper’s handling of **environmental uncertainties**. By introducing variability into our queuing models, we capture how unpredictable factors affect system performance over time.
  
#### **Integration in Our Framework**:
- This paper strengthens our goal of **tracking and responding to uncertain conditions** by prioritizing sensor inputs and adapting decision-making processes based on the level of uncertainty. The **LSTM-based failure prediction** mechanism further aligns with the need to anticipate system breakdowns under high-uncertainty scenarios.

### **3. "Resilient Computation Offloading for Real-Time Mobile Autonomous Systems"**

This paper discusses **task offloading** in real-time autonomous systems, where processing is distributed across local and remote resources to handle high-complexity scenarios and maintain resilience.

#### **Relation to Our Framework**:
- **Local Processing Focus**: While our framework currently focuses on **on-vehicle processing**, this paper provides insights into future extensions of our model, where we may need to consider **network latency** if tasks are offloaded to remote systems or the cloud.
- **Real-Time Constraints**: This paper's focus on **real-time task management** in complex scenarios aligns with our goal of **tracking and optimizing algorithmic latency**. Although we don’t explicitly handle offloading in this version, the **failure prediction** models we’ve implemented are designed to prevent real-time constraints from leading to system failures.

#### **Mathematics Connection**:
- The mathematical models in this paper, particularly around managing task latency during offloading, parallel our use of **queuing models** for **local latency management**. The techniques for managing **task scheduling** in offloaded environments could be integrated into future iterations of our framework to optimize resource distribution across cloud systems.

#### **Integration in Our Framework**:
- While task offloading is not a focus in this version, this paper provides a roadmap for extending our **latency measurement** to include **distributed systems** and network latency. As our system grows in complexity, we may incorporate elements of **resilient task offloading** to maintain real-time performance.

### **4. "Failure Prediction for Autonomous Systems"**

This paper provides insights into **failure prediction models** for autonomous systems, specifically focusing on using **historical data** to predict and preempt system failures.

#### **Relation to Our Framework**:
- **LSTM Failure Prediction**: This paper directly supports our decision to implement an **LSTM-based failure prediction** model. The idea of using **time-series data** (e.g., latency measurements) to predict when the system is likely to fail is a key part of our framework.
- **Failure Modes**: The paper also emphasizes documenting **failure modes** and correlating them with specific operational conditions, which aligns with our **testing and research plan** to explore failure modes under various complexity levels.

#### **Mathematics Connection**:
- Our LSTM-based model is built on the same principles discussed in this paper—using historical **time-series data** to predict failure points. The **binary cross-entropy loss** used for predicting failure likelihood mirrors the predictive methods outlined in the paper.

#### **Integration in Our Framework**:
- This paper provides the theoretical foundation for our **failure prediction mechanism**. By building on the methods described, we ensure that our **LSTM-based failure prediction** aligns with state-of-the-art approaches to **autonomous system resilience**.
