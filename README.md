## Latency Optimization Framework

This repository contains the research and accompanying code for **"Dynamic Optimization and Latency Management in Autonomous and Real-Time Systems."** The framework explores cutting-edge strategies to manage and optimize algorithmic and computational latency in high-performance, real-time systems, such as autonomous vehicles and cloud task systems.

The research integrates **Queue Theory**, **Computational Efficiency**, and **Dynamic Orchestration** techniques to propose a **Generalized Optimization Framework** capable of reducing system latency while balancing cost and resource constraints. It also introduces the **Super Ego** agent, a chore orchestration neural network that dynamically adapts system behavior to manage indeterminate and adversarial conditions.

Key features include:
- Theoretical foundations of latency optimization in real-time systems
- Mathematical models for managing queue theory and system bottlenecks
- Practical examples of applying these concepts to autonomous vehicle systems
- A generalized framework for latency reduction, cost optimization, and task scheduling
